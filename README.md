# üì≤ Relay Control with SMS using an AVR microcontroller  
The RCS_AVR project is an interactive, hands-on initiative focused on remote relay control via SMS. 
It includes components like a Power Supply Unit (PSU) for multiple voltage levels, a GSM Module for SMS command processing, an AVR Microcontroller (ATMEGA328) for control logic, and various inputs and outputs for seamless interaction. 
Communication occurs through protocols like UART. 
This project provides practical insights into embedded systems, covering GSM module integration, power supply management, microcontroller interfacing, remote control mechanisms, and sensor data processing.
This project serves as an excellent platform for learning and experimenting with embedded systems, offering practical insights into real-world applications.

# üíª How to Use Git and GitHub
To access the repository files and save them on your computer, there are two methods available:
1. **Using Git Bash and Cloning the Repository**
   - This method is more suitable for advanced users and those familiar with command-line tools.
   - By using this method, you can easily receive updates for the repository.

2. **Downloading the Repository as a ZIP file**
   - This method is simpler and suitable for users who are not comfortable with command-line tools.
   - Note that with this method, you will not automatically receive updates for the repository and will need to manually download any new updates.

## Clone using the URL.
First, open **Git Bash** :
-  Open the folder in **File Explorer** where you want the library to be stored.
-  **Right-click** inside the folder and select the option **"Open Git Bash here"** to open **Git Bash** in that directory.

![open Git Bash](Images/Step0.png)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.  
> You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
> For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/RCS_AVR
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.

![Clone the Repository](Images/Step1.png)

- Then, press Enter to start the cloning operation and wait for the success message to appear.

![Open the Library File](Images/Step2.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please keep in mind that the numbers displayed in the image might vary when you perform the same actions.  
> This is because repositories are continuously being updated and expanded. Nevertheless, the overall process remains unchanged.

> [!NOTE]
> Advantage of Cloning the Repository:  
> - **Receiving Updates:** By cloning the repository, you can easily and automatically receive new updates.  
> - **Version Control:** Using Git allows you to track changes and revert to previous versions.  
> - **Team Collaboration:** If you are working on a project with a team, you can easily sync changes from team members and collaborate more efficiently.  

## Download Zip
If you prefer not to use Git Bash or the command line, you can download the repository directly from GitHub as a ZIP file.  
Follow these steps:  
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository page and Locate the Code button:
   - On the main page of the repository, you will see a green Code button near the top right corner.

2. Download the repository:
   - Click the Code button to open a dropdown menu.
   - Select Download ZIP from the menu.

  ![Download Zip](Images/Step7.png)  

3. Save the ZIP file:
   - Choose a location on your computer to save the ZIP file and click Save.

4. Extract the ZIP file:
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved the ZIP file.
   - Right-click on the ZIP file and select Extract All... (Windows) or use your preferred extraction tool.
   - Choose a destination folder and extract the contents.

5. Access the repository:
   - Once extracted, you can access the repository files in the destination folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - No Updates: Keep in mind that downloading the repository as a ZIP file does not allow you to receive updates.    
>   If the repository is updated, you will need to download it again manually.  
> - Ease of Use: This method is simpler and suitable for users who are not comfortable with Git or command-line tools.
