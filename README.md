# Rrelay Control with SMS Project
The RCS_AVR project is an Embedded System AVR learning initiative with an interactive and hands-on approach. This project focuses on relay control via SMS, utilizing various components to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

This project serves as an excellent platform for learning and experimenting with embedded systems, offering practical insights into real-world applications.

### Components:
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: Provides different voltage levels (12V, 5V, 4V, 3.3V) for powering the modules.
- **GSM Module**: Enables the reception and processing of SMS commands for controlling the relay.
- **Microcontroller (MC)**: Central processing unit that interfaces with all other components, executing control logic.
- **Relay**: Facilitates the switching of external devices based on SMS or remote control commands.
- **Remote Control (ASK)**: Offers remote control capabilities.
- **Input Module**: Manages inputs from keys, sensors, and other devices.
- **Sensor Module**: Monitors environmental parameters and sends data to the microcontroller.

### Communication
The components communicate through various protocols, including UART, ensuring seamless interaction and control.

### Project Status
The hardware design for the RCS_AVR project is complete. Currently, the assembly and programming phases are ongoing.

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding GSM module integration for SMS-based control.
- Managing power supply for embedded systems.
- Hands-on experience with microcontroller programming and interfacing.
- Exploring remote control mechanisms using ASK modules.
- Implementing sensor data acquisition and processing.

  In this video, we design a 12-5-4-3.3V power supply, add fuses, and include voltage indicators.

- [aKaReZa 72 - RCS, AVR - PART C](https://youtu.be/bh53Z6KH728)
  --- 
  In this video, we review all your Issues and Pull Requests, introduce some useful software, complete the project's power supply section, and discuss upcoming channel content and plans.

- [aKaReZa 73 - RCS, AVR - PART D](https://youtu.be/vWiSh-8D4kY)
  --- 
  In this video, after designing the controller and output sections, we learn hierarchical design, create the project hierarchically, and finally generate the project's library file.

- [aKaReZa 75 - RCS, AVR - PART E](https://youtu.be/V0r4XVZA-bk)
  ---
  In this video, we cover using character LCDs, the Harness tool in Altium Designer, identifying VCC, VEE, VDD, and VSS pins, connecting a SIM card and UART protocol to a GSM module, adding power filters and a network status LED to the GSM module, and reviewing some GSM module tips. Additionally, we check the raised Pull Requests and Issues.

- [aKaReZa 79 - RCS, AVR - PART F](https://youtu.be/U1JYVCcn27k)
  --- 
  In this video, we review raised Pull Requests and Issues, organize the project, design the input section and 220V signal detection, design the code-learn remote section, fix errors, resize the board to fit the casing, introduce the "Hami Bash" section, and discuss the idea of casing installation.

- [aKaReZa 81 - RCS, AVR - PART G](https://youtu.be/6VrP90s_HFc)
  --- 
  In this video, we address the issues raised on GitHub, make several schematic changes, place components in the PCB environment, route several sections, and learn a crucial tip about capacitor placement.

- [aKaReZa 83 - RCS, AVR - PART H](https://youtu.be/ByZ2kSmf6VU)
  ---
  In this video, we continue routing the board. After completing the routes, we learn how to strengthen power paths, place screws on the board, and use the Polygon, Teardrops, and Via stitching tools.

# üíª How to Use Git and GitHub

First, open **Git Bash** :
-  Open the folder in **File Explorer** where you want the library to be stored.
-  **Right-click** inside the folder and select the option **"Open Git Bash here"** to open **Git Bash** in that directory.

> Note: If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.
> 
>  You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
>  
>  For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/RCS_AVR
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.
